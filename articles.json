Repairs are still ongoing after the floods caused damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nOn Sunday, parts of the road near the Umdloti beach resort north of Durban had been washed away, leaving gaping holes and cars balanced on the edge, AFP news agency reported.\u201cThe flooding started late yesterday [Saturday] afternoon but as a result of the collapse of this road we couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d one local resident, Kevin Govender, told AFP.They were only able to get out once the emergency services arrived on Sunday.Nearly 250 people were evacuated from the resort town overnight and rescue operations continued on Sunday, as the emergency services received more calls for help. Some homes have lost power.\nThe water purification station for the eThekwini area close to Durban has also been damaged, said officials.The South African Weather Service put the alert level at the highest on Saturday. Officials called on residents to stay at home.Authorities in KwaZulu-Natal opened 82 reception centres while police, firefighters and rescue workers were ready to respond rapidly to emergencies. The army has also been called in for reinforcement and officials have evacuated elderly people in several villages.On Monday, the weather service said conditions had improved significantly but still they expect the rains to continue in parts of the province.",

    "content": "Lagos, Nigeria \u2013 On February 22, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced during a news conference that the European superpower was halting approval of Russia-owned Nord Stream 2 after President Vladimir Putin officially sent troops into eastern Ukraine.Nord Stream 2, an $11bn gas pipeline project owned by Moscow-backed energy company Gazprom, runs from western Siberia to Germany. The project was built to ensure a sustainable energy distribution across the European Union, especially as gas prices reached record highs in Europe \u2013 which gets more than a third of its natural gas from Russia.As the conflict continues in Ukraine, European gas prices have soared and there is the likelihood that Moscow could shut off supplies of gas, widely considered part of Putin\u2019s leverage against the West in his obsession with Ukraine.Before that, European countries will be pulling the stops to find contingency supply networks in the coming weeks. In fact, sources say the United States is already in talks with Qatar over supplying gas to the EU as a crucial substitute for Russia.However, during a forum of gas exporting countries held last week in Qatar, the bloc said it would be unable to provide a considerable amount of replacement gas to Europe in the event of sanctions against Russia. They stressed the need for significant investment in gas infrastructure, as well as long-term contracts, to guarantee a large supply to Europe.This has led to an emerging debate about whether African countries, which have some of the world\u2019s deepest gas reserves, can step in to fill the gap \u2013 a demand of 150-190 billion cubic metres annually that Russia has usually supplied to Europe.Recently,\u00a0Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan said the Russian invasion of Ukraine could prove to be an opportunity for gas sales as the East African country makes efforts to secure a new energy market outside Africa. \u201cWhether Africa or Europe or America, we are looking for markets,\u201d said Hassan. \u201cAnd fortunately, we are working with companies from Europe.\u201dTanzania, which has the sixth-largest gas reserves in Africa \u2013 an estimated 57 trillion cubic feet (1.6 billion cubic metres) of gas reserves \u2013 says it has been working with Shell to utilise its vast offshore gas resources and export to Europe and elsewhere.Africa\u2019s largest gas producer has similar plans too. Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s junior petroleum minister, told the press at the gas exporting countries\u2019 forum in Doha, \u201cWe want to build a pipeline, a trans-Sahara pipeline, that is going to take our gas to Algeria, then to Europe.\u201dNigeria\u2019s comments are buoyed by the recent signing of an MoU with Algeria and the Niger Republic and the ongoing construction of the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline, a 614km (381.5 miles) long natural gas pipeline beginning in northern Nigeria.There is no official word on when the pipeline, first mooted in the 1970s, will be completed but it is slated to run through northern Nigeria into Niger and Algeria, connecting to Europe eventually.Still there are concerns about whether African countries can become a proper stopgap solution for natural gas as Europe tackles Russia\u2019s military onslaught against one of its own \u2013 or long-term suppliers.Experts say a historic lack of investment in gas infrastructure has hampered the energy industry in sub-Saharan Africa, unlike in Northern Africa.For instance, the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline in Algeria \u2013 Africa\u2019s largest natural gas exporter \u2013 conveys natural gas through Morocco to Spain and Portugal, and the Medgaz pipeline links Algeria directly to Spain.Experts estimated that Algeria exported 9 billion cubic feet (255 million cubic metres) of gas to Spain in 2020 and up to 17 billion cubic feet (481 million cubic metres) annually before that. The drop was due to gas production dipping in a breakdown in relations with Morocco; last October, Algeria announced that it would immediately begin exporting gas directly to Spain.\u201cIt is important to note that [North] Africa already has an established gas export market with Europe [before the Ukrainian crisis],\u201d said Linda Mabhena-Olagunju, oil and gas lawyer and CEO of Johannesburg-based independent power producer DLO Energy Resource Group. \u201cThe Medgaz pipeline capacity enhancements [in Algeria] are also expected to increase exports to Europe.\u201dBut many African countries with massive gas reserves have also struggled to attract investment to build gas infrastructure projects to supply the European market.Angola, which has 13.5 trillion cubic feet (382 billion cubic metres) of proven gas reserves, has experienced a sharp decline in oil and gas production in the last five years due to a combination of technical and operational problems, as well as a lack of upstream investment and incentives.In 2020, the Muhammadu Buhari administration announced \u201cThe Decade of Gas\u201d, a Nigerian initiative to prioritise the gas industry and take advantage of a global transition to cleaner fuels.As part of that drive, it has commenced construction of the 614km-long, $2.5bn Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Natural Gas Pipeline. Most of the funding comes as a loan from Chinese banks.Still, like in many other African countries, significant investments are needed to build trans-regional and intercontinental pipelines, in order to open up access to Europe. And they all need loads of capital.Nigeria is hoping that its new industry legislation \u2013 signed last August \u2013 can provide a new framework to cut down on waste and corruption in the oil sector, reshape host community relations and ultimately, investment.\u201cNigeria is not presently a top investment destination for the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Nigeria and ex-adviser to the junior petroleum minister. \u201cThis was why we pushed for a competitive fiscal arrangement in the bill.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, to address the infrastructure challenge, we need to open up the sector to private capital,\u201d he said. \u201cOur current oligopoly would not suffice as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation lacks the capital to build our required infrastructure.\u201dUsing vessels for direct transport of liquefied natural gas across the seas could also put sub-Saharan African countries in prime position to become competitive producers and exporters, Mabhena-Olagunju told Al Jazeera.There are also other existential issues that experts say African countries have to fix first to be a ready alternative for Europe in situations of urgency.Mozambique holds roughly 100 trillion cubic feet (2.8 trillion cubic metres) of proven natural gas reserves, accounting for approximately 1 percent of the world\u2019s total reserves. But an\u00a0ongoing armed uprising\u00a0in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, a gas-rich area that borders Tanzania, has\u00a0hampered activity on a planned $50bn project.Elsewhere, a wave of security threats from armed groups has affected oil and gas exploration in Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta.\u201cThe key factor that remains a challenge for Africa as a reliable LNG producer and exporter revolves around security of supply,\u201d said Mabhena-Olagunju. \u201cWhilst the LNG discoveries in Mozambique are a great find, it is also important to recognise that insecurity leads to delays and instability of supply.\u201dCan African countries wing it?",

    "content": "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has arrived in Mozambique, where he has deployed some 1,000 soldiers to help local security forces tackle fighters wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s north.Attacks by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017. The violence, including the raiding of villages and towns, has killed more than 3,306 people \u2013 half of them civilians \u2013 and displaced at least 800,000 from their homes over the past four years.Rwanda in July was the first of several African countries to provide reinforcements to Mozambique\u2019s army, overwhelmed by the worsening conflict in the gas-rich province. A contingent of forces from the regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is also patrolling northern Cabo Delgado.Kagame landed in the provincial capital, Pemba, on Friday morning and was received by his Mozambican counterpart, Filipe Nyusi. The two leaders met and addressed Rwandan troops deployed to the province.President Nyusi welcomes President Kagame to Pemba, Mozambique for a two-day working visit. The Presidents will meet with the Rwandan Joint Forces working with Mozambican Defence Armed Forces in Cabo Delgado, followed by t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and bilateral meetings and a press conference. pic.twitter.com/5IgFJMRl8f\u2014 Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) September 24, 2021In a joint news conference, Kagame said Rwandan troops would help secure and rebuild the areas destroyed by the violence.\u201cThe work hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d Kagame told his soldiers, according to posts on the Rwandan presidency\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cYou have done great work alongside Mozambican troops. You sacrificed and endured days and nights in the scorching sun, heavy rains,\u201d he said.\u201cThe work done so far cannot stop here. We now have another task which is to continue rebuilding and protecting this country.\u201dFor his part, Nyusi called Rwandan troops \u201creal heroes\u201d, adding that Mozambique\u2019s \u201csoldiers are forever indebted to you and we look forward to continuing rebuilding the lives of our citizens for the better\u201d.  \n Foreign forces have helped Mozambique regain ground in Cabo Delago since fighters linked to ISIL (ISIS) launched a coordinated assault on the port town of Palma in March, offsetting multibillion-dollar gas projects and raising international concern.Some local officials have encouraged civilians to return, according to media reports, and the Rwandan military\u2019s spokesman said 25,000 people had been brought home. \u201cIt is very safe for them to go back,\u201d Ronald Rwivanga told Reuters news agency on Thursday.But United Nations officials are not so sure.A document compiled in September for UN agencies and other aid groups, seen by Reuters, said it was not clear whether the fighters\u2019 capabilities had been much reduced. \u201cFighting continues in certain locations and civilian authorities have not been re-established,\u201d it added.Al Jazeera\u2019s Malcolm Webb, reporting from an abandoned town in Cabo Delgado, said the remains of what the fighters had left behind were still visible.\u201cA lot of the buildings have been torched, goods from the shops have been looted, cars have been set on fire as well,\u201d he added.\u201cCivilians in this area really fear the fighters from this armed group. They are notorious for beheadings, for abducting people and all of the villages that we passed along the road are still completely deserted.\u201d  \n Rwivanga said the Rwandans had been moving civilians back into the area they control near a $20bn liquefied natural gas (LNG) project run by oil major TotalEnergies, which was forced to a halt by the Palma attack.Yet security analysts say the Mozambican military deficiencies that allowed the armed campaign to take hold in the north \u2013 including soldiers that are ill-equipped, undisciplined and poorly paid \u2013 will not be easily reversed. Even with other forces there, they say, security is uncertain outside of small, heavily guarded areas.Mozambican and Rwandan forces notched up a major victory in August, when they drove the fighters out of their de facto headquarters in the port city of Mocimboa da Praia.But violence has continued. Local people and security forces have recently reported a string of attacks in Quissanga district, south of Mocimba da Praia, where fighters are believed to have fallen back after the town was retaken. The latest occurred on Thursday evening in the village of Lindi.\u201cTwo people were killed and another two people were injured,\u201d an unnamed police source was quoted as saying by AFP news agency on Friday, adding that fighters had captured several women and girls.Fighters also ambushed two buses transporting soldiers later that night, causing at least one death, a traffic police officer told AFP. The attack took place on a main road that had been closed for two years due to similar incidents, and only recently reopened following the arrival of foreign troops.In total, at least 10 people have been killed across several villages in Quissanga over the past week, another police officer said. Some of the victims were reportedly beheaded.  \n ",

Nearly all of these refugees arrived in neighbouring India (17,000) and Bangladesh (12,000).In Europe, at least 89,000 refugees fled from Azerbaijan to Armenia following 44 days of fighting that broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.Across the Atlantic, during 2020, the United States received 8,500 refugees from 20 countries. Nearly half of these refugees came from only three countries: Venezuela (1,600), El Salvador (1,200), and Guatemala (1,100). This is significantly lower than in 2019 when the country received 32,000 refugees.Canada received 7,500 refugees from 21 countries in 2020. The top countries of origin were Nigeria (1,400), Iran (1,200) and Hungary (629). On the other side of the globe, Australia received only 956 refugees in 2020 \u2013 mostly from Iran.Refugee camps are intended as temporary safe haven to meet refugees\u2019 basic needs. However, many people end up living in these camps for decades. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kenya: \u201cMany displaced persons spend more than 16 years living as refugees in temporary shelter.\u201dThe infographic below highlights some of the largest refugee camps around the world.The Kutupalong camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, is the world\u2019s largest refugee camp. It was set up informally in the early 1990s after Myanmar\u2019s minority Rohingya began to flee several crackdowns on them in Rakhine state.In 2017, brutal crackdowns tore through the state and the camp had to be significantly expanded, reaching a capacity of approximately 800,000 people.On March 22, 2021, a huge fire engulfed a neighbouring refugee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Fifteen people were killed and tens of thousands were left without their homes and belongings.The Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya comprises three large refugee camps \u2013 Hagadera, Dagahaley and Ifo \u2013 and houses more than 200,000 refugees near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in 1991 following the civil war in Somalia and expanded in 2011 following widespread drought and famine.The Kakuma refugee camp in northwest Kenya is home to at least 150,000 refugees mostly from South Sudan and Somalia. The camp was established in 1992 following the arrival of thousands of Sudanese children who were fleeing the civil war.In March 2021, Kenya\u2019s government announced that it would close the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps by June 30, 2022.The Zaatari refugee camp\u00a0was established in Jordan in 2012 to house Syrian refugees. Today, it is the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world. The world\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccination centre in a refugee camp opened there in February 2021.In 1951, the UN established the 1951 Refugee Convention, set up to protect the rights of refugees in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. In 1967, the convention was expanded to address displacement across the rest of the world.The infographic below highlights 70 years of refugee journeys, from 1951 to 2020. The number of refugees has more than doubled over the past decade from 15 million in 2011 to 30 million in 2020.The plight of Palestinian refugees is the longest unresolved refugee problem in the world. On May 14, 1948, the British Mandate for Palestine expired, triggering the first Arab-Israeli war. Zionist militias expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians. According to figures compiled by UNHCR, by 1952 the number of Palestinian refugees was 867,000. Today, that figure is 5.7 million.Afghanistan has been ravaged by four decades of war. From 1979 to 1989, the country was a stage for one of the Cold War\u2019s last battles as Soviet troops fought a bloody guerrilla war against the Afghan mujahideen. For the next decade, the county struggled on. Just 12 years after the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan would find itself invaded again, this time by the US. The highest number of Afghan refugees was recorded in 1990 where 6.3 million refugees were reported.At 6.7 million people, Syrians are the biggest population of refugees today followed by Palestinians (5.7 million) and Venezuelans (4 million). As of 2020, 88 percent of the world\u2019s refugees originated from only 12 countries.On the receiving end, 65 percent of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by only 16 countries. Turkey hosts the most refugees (3.7 million) followed by Jordan (3 million) and Colombia (1.7 million).In Europe, Germany is home to about 1.2 million refugees, the highest in the continent.According to UNHCR, developing countries host 86 percent of the world\u2019s refugees.",

    "content": "Fighters in conflict-hit northern Mozambique abducted dozens of children during raids in 2020, according to a new analysis by Save the Children.The charity said in a report on Wednesday the \u201cabduction of children has become a new and alarmingly regular tactic by armed groups\u201d in Cabo Delgado province, where worsening fighting over the past three-and-a-half years has killed nearly 3,000 people and displaced more than 700,000, half of whom are children.Save the Children said \u201cat least 51 children, most of them girls\u201d were seized by non-state armed groups in the region last year, adding that the numbers involved were likely \u201cfar higher\u201d than its estimates, which were based on data collected by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and reflected only reported cases.It warned that the victims are at risk of sexual violence, early marriage and being used as fighters in the conflict.\u201cBeing abducted, witnessing abductions, experiencing attacks, being forced to flee from armed groups \u2013 these are extremely traumatising events for young children and adolescents,\u201d said Chance Briggs, the Mozambique country director for Save the Children.Attacks by an armed group\u00a0known locally\u00a0as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017.The sophistication of the attacks has increased, too.The fighters linked to ISIL (ISIS) have ransacked towns and gained control of key roadways, destroying infrastructure and beheading civilians. In some cases, they have forced locals into their ranks or held them as sex slaves.Since August 2020, the fighters have been in control of the key port town of Mocimboa da Praia, while in March, they launched a coordinated assault on Palma town, killing dozens and forcing more than 67,000 to abandon their homes.A video by the group distributed in August last year \u2013 filmed in either Mozambique or the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the US-based SITE Intelligence Group \u2013 showed three gun-toting children flanked by adults in front of an ISIL banner.\u201cAbducting a child constitutes one of the six grave violations against children in times of conflict, as defined by the United Nations. It is against international humanitarian law and can be a first step towards war crimes such as forced child conscription or sexual violence against children,\u201d Briggs said.\u201cEvery day spent by abducted children outside their community is one too many, and the risks of abuse, early marriage and pregnancy increase the more time goes by.\u201d  \n Save the Children called for the immediate release of all abducted children and for the perpetrators to be held to account.It said children were sometimes targeted for abduction in large groups, citing one attack where 21 people were abducted in a group, including six children.\u201cIn that same incident, at least seven fishermen were beheaded,\u201d it said.In another attack in June 2020, 10 girls were taken while drawing water from a well, it added.The charity highlighted the recent abduction of a 14-year-old girl following the March 24 attack on Palma. She and her family had in August 2020 fled their fishing village to seek shelter in the town.But seven months later, \u201carmed men entered Palma and forced the family to flee again. On the way to seek safety, the family was abducted by armed men. They all escaped except for their eldest daughter,\u201d it said, citing the teenager\u2019s father.Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had registered more than 2,600 appeals in Mozambique between September 2020 and April 2021 from people who lost track of family members, most of whom are young adults and children.\u201cThere is a very high number of unaccompanied children [who are] extremely vulnerable to all kinds of abuses and exploitation,\u201d said James Matthews, deputy head of the ICRC\u2019s mission in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo.  \n ",

    "content": "White contractors were prioritised for evacuation ahead of Black locals during a rescue operation following an attack in March by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab on the Mozambican town of Palma, according to Amnesty International.In a report compiled from interviews with 11 Black survivors, Amnesty on Thursday charged that even dogs were pulled to safety before Black people by a helicopter that airlifted civilians from a hotel where they had sought refuge.\u201cWhite contractors [were] airlifted to safety before local Black people,\u201d said Amnesty, adding the hotel manager took his two German Shepherd dogs on the rescue helicopter, leaving people behind.Dyck Advisory Group (DAG), a South Africa private company hired to help the Mozambique government fight the armed group and which was involved in the rescue operation, rejected the allegations.\u201cWe rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 Black persons of differing nationalities,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cThe DAG team did not choose who would or would not be evacuated, they secured the landing site and loaded the people that were sent to them for evacuation by the lodge manager,\u201d it added.Dyck Advisory Group reacts to Amnesty International claims that white expats and dogs were prioritised for evacuation before black Mozambiquans in Palma \"We rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 black persons\" pic.twitter.com/lRBOajooG6\u2014 Will Brown (@_Will_Brown) May 14, 2021Some 200 people, mainly civil servants and foreigners working on a nearby gas project, sheltered in the Amarula Palma Hotel during the attack on Palma that began on March 24.Amnesty said there were about 20 white workers among the group holed up in the beachfront hotel.\u201cWhile the white contractors were prioritised to be airlifted to safety, the Black nationals were left to fend for themselves. After the majority of the white contractors and a few well-off Black nationals \u2013 among them the Administrator for Palma \u2013 were rescued, those left behind attempted to flee by ground convoy\u201d but were ambushed by al-Shabab, Amnesty said.Deprose Muchena, the rights watchdog\u2019s regional director for east and southern Africa, said \u201cthese are alarming allegations that the rescue plan was racially segregated.\u201d\u201cAbandoning people during an armed assault simply because of the colour of their skin is racism, and violates the obligation to protect civilians,\u201d he said, adding that for the hotel manager to \u201cchoose to rescue his dogs instead of people is also extremely shocking\u201d.One survivor told Amnesty that \u201cwe didn\u2019t want all white people to be rescued, because we knew that if all the whites left, we would be left there to die. We heard them talking about the plan to take all the whites and leave\u201d the Black people.  \n But a white survivor, South African Wesley Nel, whose brother died in the attack, denied the discrimination claims.\u201cI was there. We all were abandoned black and white,\u201d tweeted Nel, whose brother Adrian Nel was killed during a deadly ambush of a convoy of cars trying to flee from the hotel.\u201cBut it was us \u2018white\u2019 people who saved 150 locals by driving us all out of there,\u201d he wrote on Twitter following the publication of the report.Several witnesses also told Amnesty the hotel manager took advantage of the chaotic situation to take his two German Shepherd dogs to safety via helicopter, leaving people behind. The helicopters could only transport six people at a time, and made a total of four trips, the rights group said.\u201cIf the dogs hadn\u2019t gone, about two or three more people could have gone on the helicopter,\u201d one survivor said. \u201cThat dismayed people because some women didn\u2019t get in the helicopter because of the dogs.\u201dTwelve decapitated bodies were found strewn in front of the hotel days after the attack, according to the army and private security sources.The attack on Palma left dozens of Mozambicans and foreigners dead, according to the government, and displaced tens of thousands.It marked a major intensification in a conflict that has wreaked havoc across Cabo Delgado province for more than three years.",
